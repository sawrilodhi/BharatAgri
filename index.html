                <h4>Methods Of Sowing</h4> 
                <p>There are various methods used for sowing the seeds.</p>
                <h5>Traditional Method</h5>
                <p>A funnel-shaped tool is used to sow the seeds traditionally. The funnel is filled with seeds and the seeds pass through two or three pipes with sharp ends. These ends enter into the soil and the seeds are placed there.</p>
                <h5>Broadcasting</h5>
                <p>In this process, the seeds are scattered on the seed beds either mechanically or manually. In the broadcasting method of sowing, the seeds are spread uniformly and are then covered with planking. When there are a large number of seeds, the work is done using mechanical broadcasters. The seed rate is very high in this system.</p>
                <h5>Dibbling</h5>
                <p>Holes are made in the seedbeds and the seeds are placed in it. The seedbeds are then covered. The holes are made at definite depths. A dibbler is used for dibbling. It is a conical instrument that makes proper holes in the seedbed. This method is usually used to sow vegetables.
               </p>
               <h5>Drilling</h5>
               <p>The seeds are dropped into furrow lines in a continuous flow and are then covered with soil. This is done either mechanically or manually. The proper amount of seeds are sown at proper depths and proper spaces. Drilling can be done in the following ways: </p>
               <ul>
                 <li>Sowing behind the plough</li>
                 <li>Bullock-drawn seed drills</li>
                 <li>Tractor-drawn seeds drills</li>
               </ul>
               <h5>Seed Dropping behind the Plough</h5>
               <p>This method is commonly used in villages to sow a variety of food crops such as maize, peas, wheat, barley, and gram. Seeds are dropped in furrows behind the plough by a device known as malobansa. It comprises of a bamboo tube with a funnel-shaped mouth. It needs two men to drop the seeds. One handles the bullocks and the plough and the other drops the seeds. However, this method consumes a lot of time and is labour-intensive.</p>
               <h5>Transplanting</h5>
               <p>In this process, the seedlings are first planted in nurseries and then planted in the prepared fields. It is usually done to grow vegetables and flowers. A transplanter is used for the purpose. But, this process is time-consuming.</p>
               <h5>Hill Dropping</h5>
               <p>In this method of sowing, the selected seeds are dropped at regular spaces but not in a continuous manner.
               </p>
               <h5>Check Row Planting</h5>
               <p>The seeds are planted along straight parallel furrows. A check row planter is used for the method. The row-to-row and plant-to-plant distance is uniform.</p>

                <h5>What is the basal fertilizers</h5>
                <p> Basal fertilization, also known as pre-planting fertilization, has the main purpose to increase soils biological fertility and concentration of mineral elements, providing big quantities of lacking nutrients.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Thanks to basal fertilization it is possible to create the agronomic basis necessary for the correct implementation of plants production.</p>
                <h6>It differs from the usual fertilization for its extraordinary application.
                </h6>
                <p>Generally, it is carried out:</p>
                <br>
                <p>only once before the cultivation of a soil for herbaceous crops;
                  before planting a woody crop (grape, fruit and olive trees).
                  Basal fertilization guarantees good results of multi-year crops such as fruit trees, while in case of crops in a protected environment, it is better to limit this type of measure because all greenhouses have drip or sprinkling water distribution systems, so fertigation can be effectively used.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h6>Dosage in basal fertilization.</h6>
                  <p>The dosage in basal fertilizations varies according to the results provided by a chemical-physical analysis of the soil concerning: nutrients supply, bulk density, texture, pH, total and active limestone, electrical conductivity, organic substance, Cation-exchange capacity (CEC), total nitrogen, assimilable phosphorus and exchangeable potassium.</p>
                  <br>
                  <h6>How basal fertilization occurs.</h6>
                  <p>This type of fertilization consists in the distribution of slow-release nutrients, which are gradually introduced during the agricultural cycle of crops. Usually, phosphate, potassic and organic fertilizers are used.
                    The guidelines in a given context may change according to the nutrients, especially in relation to their mobility in the soil:</p>
                    <p>Nitrogen is the main macronutrient for crops and it is very mobile, both in soil and plants.
                      For this reason, its application before transplanting in open field crops is strongly discouraged and must be minimized in protected crops (max 10% of total removals).
                      </p>
                      <br>
                      <p>Phosphorus is an element with low mobility, which stimulates the development of new roots and it is suitable for pre-planting fertilization.</p><br>
                      <p>Potassium is not very mobile in soil too and it’s particularly suitable for basal fertilizations. It is the element that improves fruits quality and, thus, its supply is recommended during their ripening.

                <h5>Irrigation</h5>
                <p> I’m sure you have heard that India is a monsoon dependent country. Therefore, rainfall has a huge impact on our agricultural output and even on our economy. But, this isn’t the dark ages. In other words, we now have modern systems that support our farmers and the agricultural sector. For instance, one such practice where we have made advancements is in Irrigation. So, let us learn more about this.</p><br>
                <p>Irrigation means the watering of land to make it ready for agriculture. It is the process of application of water to crops through artificial channels to grow them.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Water is vital for the growth of plants. And, there can be no plants or crops if they do not have access to water in some form. It is, thus, crucial to supply water to crops and plants in time as per their need. The supply of water to plants comes from various water resources. For example,</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>wells</li>
                  <li>ponds</li>
                  <li>lakes</li>
                  <li>canals</li>
                  <li>dams and reservoirs 
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h5>Harvesting:</h5>
                <p>The process of cutting and gathering a crop is called harvesting. The traditional implement used to harvest a crop is the sickle. Modern farms use a harvester, which cuts the crop. A harvester can be combined with other machinery that threshes and cleans the grain as well. It is then called a combine harvester or combine.</p><br>
                <p>After the crop is gathered, the grain is separated by a process called threshing. This can be done manually by striking the crop against a hard surface or by making farm animals trample over the crop.</p><br>
                <p>A machine called a thresher is used to do the job in modern farms, else combines are used to harvest, thresh and winnow. Winnowing means separating the outer cover, or chaff, from the grain. It can be done manually, by dropping the grain and chaff from a height, and letting the wind blow away the chaff.</p>

                <h6>Storage:</h6>
                <p>Cereals and pulses can be stored much longer than fruit and vegetables, which spoil easily. Spoilage, depends to a great extent on the moisture content of the food to be stored. The way grains are stored, thus, differs from the way fruit and vegetables are stored.

                <br>
                <h6>Grains:</h6>
                <p>Harvested grains are usually dried before being stored because moisture encourages the growth of microorganisms. They are then stored in metal or earthen containers, gunny bags or grain silos. The godowns where grains are stored are first fumigated to get rid of pests. Fumigation is the process of using the vapours of a chemical to get rid of pests and infections. The chemical can be sprayed using hand-operated machines.</p>
                <br>
                <h6>Cold storage</h6>
                <p>Fruit and vegetables are stored in cold storages, where the temperature is maintained between 0°C and 4°C. This discourages the growth of microorganisms. It also stops the enzymes present in the fruit and vegetables from spoiling them.

                  However, if the temperature becomes too low, the stored fruit and vegetables can get destroyed. The other thing that has to be controlled in a cold storage is humidity. The humidity is kept pretty high because fruit and vegetables lose moisture when the humidity is low.</p>
